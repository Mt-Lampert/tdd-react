# Test-Driven React

This is my personal version of Bashar Buyukharahman's React Course in test-driven development. Nothing special, actually. It's what I want to learn for my own projects because I want to feel safe and successful in what I do with React.

The most important thing about this project is not the source code but the `journal.md` file where I report about the things I learned on a daily basis. Keeping it well-written on a daily basis (and always be honest writing it) is the biggest challenge in this endeavor. Wish me luck, discipline and honesty.
